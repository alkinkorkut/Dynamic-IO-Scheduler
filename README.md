# Dynamic-IO-Scheduler

This is a project that I have developed with my friends Emir Mehmet Eryılmaz and Ezgi Alışan. This project is developed for Operating Systems lecture. The project consists of a research paper which contains analysis of some IO Scheduler's in Linux. Also, it includes a dynamic IO scheduler program which switches the IO scheduler depending on block size and record length.
